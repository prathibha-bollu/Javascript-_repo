The JavaScript component provides the interactivity and real-time updates as users adjust Flexbox properties. Experiment with flex direction, wrapping, alignment, item order, and more, all while observing real-time changes in the layout. The responsive design ensures adaptability for different screen sizes, and each item is color-coded for clarity
